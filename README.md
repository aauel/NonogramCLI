# NonogramCLI

This is a personal project of mine to practice Object Oriented Programming with Java.  I started it around week 3 into my Tech Elevator bootcamp, and spent many, many hours getting it operational.  I've since started refactoring many aspects of the design, so the code as it exists here is not functional.  However, the last operational version is available to run on Repl.it here:

Nonograms are my favorite type of puzzle to work on.  In case they are new to you, here is an introduction!

## Nonograms
Nonograms, also known as Picross or Griddlers, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of "4 8 3" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive sets.
